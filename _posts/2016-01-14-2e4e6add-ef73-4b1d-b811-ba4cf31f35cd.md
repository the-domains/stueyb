Synergy of angles. Gentle light folding its white cloak around shapes round, flat cylindrical. Then reflected light, bright spots where the shadows have holes.

I still don't know why this image enthrals me so much. It is for sure all of the things mentioned above, but there is also the figure, the subtle awareness of her skeletal structure, her musculature, the combination of both that hold her in this most unusual pose.

It was one of those moments when the model was moving from one thing to the next, and you shout stop! I can't help feel that this image is a really important one in my portfolio, and I will be staring at it for a long time... in an attempt to better understand it and my direction.
