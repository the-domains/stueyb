Melissa is such a great model. Very body aware. She knows exactly what her various extremities are doing. It makes my job so much easier. Allows me to focus on shapes and how the light makes them even more three dimensional.

The pose here is relaxed, she's almost asleep, yet it's so poised with dynamic energy from the angles and the crop. Take a few moments and allow your eye to be drawn from top left, where her hand is pointing and where she enters the frame with her right arm. 

Allow your eye to sweep to the bottom right. This movement is very natural for westerners, as it's how we development our natural scanning movement left to right through the process of learning to read. If you follow the hand to the elbow as an arrow head then the image feels energetic, but if you follow the line of the torso to the bottom, then the image feels relaxed.
