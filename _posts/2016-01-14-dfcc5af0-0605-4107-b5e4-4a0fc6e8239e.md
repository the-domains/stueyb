Just love this pose... beautiful diagonals, skin tones and shapes full of dynamism. Yet there's something very relaxed and easy about it. Melissa's hand and hair fall relaxed, as if nothing but gravity is acting upon them, and her body almost caught mid-stretch, breathing in, arching backwards, as if forced by the sunlight flooding the room.

The elbow is like an arrow head pointing the eye from the brightness of the hair, bottom left, out of the frame and into the light top right. The hand leads the eye top left to bottom right, in alignment with the torso. Direction is from left to right, with the energy of the top and calm of the bottom. This in contrast to how we feel about the movement of the model... which is right to left.

Shot on my FujiFilm X-Pro1 with the 35mm 1.4\.
