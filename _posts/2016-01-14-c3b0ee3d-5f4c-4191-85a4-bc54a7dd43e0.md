A genuine reflection, shot through the camera and not simply rigged in Photoshop. I love shooting into mirrors and highly reflective surfaces, it's like peaking into a parallel universe, where everything happens exactly the same but the other way around.

So this image is like seeing two universes butting up against each other, creating a third, where movement creates a kaleidoscopic effect in our minds.
